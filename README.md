# Bucket-List

In this project Joe (minh) Nguyen , Jesus Diaz , Amalec Guzman all worked togethere to develop a site called The Bucket List .

In order to create this site we used bulma as the css framework and mostly used javascript and jquery .

We also used apis to call out certain information in order to make the website function at its highest capacity .
we used https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api for our movie information

we used the new york times api

The purpose of this application is to be able to be able to find movies that someone might be interested in watching at the moment or at a later date. This application allows users to search for movies in a few different ways. One of the ways is to be able to search for a specific movie by the title. Another way is by looking at the critic reviews.
There is a movie generator that will allow the user to find a movie by the chosen genre.
This application also allows you to save the movie information to be able to refer back to it for later use.
